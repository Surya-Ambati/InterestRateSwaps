This Repo is divided into three parts, mirroring the structure of a typical trading desk:

Part 1: Cash, Repo, and Swap Markets

Topic 1: Fixed-Income Basics

Covers the basics of bonds, including:
Time value of money (e.g., 100 today is worth more than 100 in a year).
Price-yield relationship (how bond prices change with interest rates).
Sensitivity measures like PV01 (price change for a 1 basis point move in yield) and convexity (how bond price changes as yields change).
Explains the repo market, where banks borrow/lend securities (like U.S. Treasuries) for short periods.

Topic 2: Pricing Plain-Vanilla Swaps

Explains how swaps are priced using:
Discount factors: The present value of future cash flows.
Forward curves: Projected future interest rates.

Example: If you have a 5-year swap, you need to know the expected interest rates for each year to calculate the cash flows.

Topic 3: Swap Market Instruments

Discusses how swaps are traded in practice, including:
Broker screens: Where traders see swap prices.
Spreads: The difference between swap rates and Treasury rates.
Explains how swaps are customized (e.g., choosing specific payment dates).

Topic 4: Basis Swaps

Basis swaps involve exchanging cash flows based on different floating rates (e.g., 3-month LIBOR vs. 6-month LIBOR).
Explains the growing importance of OIS (Overnight Indexed Swaps), which are tied to overnight rates and are used for margining swaps.

Part 2: Interest-Rate Flow Options

Topic 5: Option Replication

Explains how options can be replicated using a binomial model (a simple model where prices move up or down in discrete steps).
Example: If you have a call option, you can replicate it by buying/selling the underlying asset in a way that mimics the option's payoff.

Topic 6: Black-Scholes and Black’s Formula

Introduces the Black-Scholes model for pricing options.
Explains Black’s Formula, which is used for pricing interest rate options like caps, floors, and swaptions.

Example: If you have a cap (which limits how high a floating rate can go), you can use Black’s Formula to price it.

Topic 7: Trading Flow Options

Explains how flow options (like caps, floors, and swaptions) are traded in practice.
Introduces the SABR model, which is used to capture volatility skews and smiles (where implied volatility varies with strike prices).

Part 3: Interest-Rate Exotics

Topic 8: Short-Rate Models

Explains models like Hull-White and BDT (Black-Derman-Toy), which are used to price more complex products like Bermudan swaptions.
Example: A Bermudan swaption allows the holder to enter into a swap at multiple dates, not just one.

Topic 9: Bermudan Options

Explains how to price Bermudan options using backward induction (a method where you start at the end of the option’s life and work backward to find its value today).

Topic 10: HJM Models

Introduces Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) models, which model the entire term structure of interest rates.
These models are more complex but provide a more accurate way to price exotics.

Topic 11: Numeraires and Forward Measures

Explains how to change numeraires (the unit in which prices are measured) to simplify pricing.
Example: By switching to a forward measure, you can justify using Black’s Formula for interest rate options.
