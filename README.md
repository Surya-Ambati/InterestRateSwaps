# InterestRateSwaps
The Repo aims to simplify the complexity of swaps and derivatives.

It focuses on mainstream products (swaps, flow options, Bermudans) rather than exotic products.

The target audience includes traders, salespeople, risk managers, and IT professionals working in interest rate products.


This repo also mimics a trading floor’s setup, split into three parts:

1) Cash, Repo, and Swap Markets: Covers bonds, repos (short-term loans), and basic swaps—stuff that doesn’t need option math.
2) Interest-Rate Flow Options: Explains simpler options like caps, floors, and swaptions, where volatility (how much rates bounce) matters.
3) Interest-Rate Exotics: Tackles complex stuff like Bermudan options and models for the whole interest rate curve, needing heavier math and computer tricks.
